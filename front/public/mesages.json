"We want to make your experience using Inbox Zero as rewarding as possible, so here are the top things our most successful users\n\nYour AI Email Assistant\n\nA personal assistant is amazing for managing email, but most of us can't spend $3,000 a month on one.\n\nThat's why we built the AI assistant. It does what a great PA would do - reads your emails, handles the routine stuff, and keeps\n\nyour inbox in check - just without the hefty price tag.\n\nIt's super easy to get going:\n\n1. Pick a role that matches what you do (like Founder, Creator, or Investor). This will set you up with some common rules people\n\n1. Tell it what you need, just like you'd tell a real assistant\n\n1. Test it out right away to make sure it's doing exactly what you want\n\n1. Adjust and fine-tune anytime - your assistant learns and adapts to your preferences\n\nSome examples of what you can ask it to do:\n\n* "Send invoices over to accounting"\n\n* "Check if someone's a customer when they ask for a meeting"\n\n* "Keep recruiting emails organized but out of my main inbox"\n\n* "Label and archive all newsletters"\n\nWatch a demo of the AI Personal Assistant:  [\n\nSet up your AI assistant [\n\nYour inbox is filled with emails that don't need your attention. Reply Zero only shows you the ones that do.\n\nWe label your emails with:\n\n* To Reply - emails you need to reply to\n\n* Awaiting Reply - emails where you're waiting to hear back from others\n\nReply Zero works within Gmail or the Inbox Zero platform.\n\nIf you use the Reply Zero view within Inbox Zero, you'll only see the emails that need handling without any other noise.\n\nWe'll also send you a weekly email with any emails that are overdue.\n\nReply Zero has been a game-changer for how we manage email ourselves and makes sure we never miss a reply or to follow up.\n\nEnable Reply Zero [\n\nBulk Unsubscriber\n\nOur bulk unsubscriber shows you frequent emailers with a button to one-click unsubscribe.\n\nWe show you how often you read emails, making it easy to unsubscribe from the ones you never read.\n\nIt also lets you archive and delete all emails from a sender in a single click.\n\nUnsubscribe from emails [\n\nCold Email Blocker\n\nKeep sales people at the gate. Filter out cold emails from hitting your inbox.\n\nThe blocker checks every first-time sender against your criteria for what counts as a cold email. We've set up default filtering\n\nthat works great for most people, but you can easily customize it to match your preferences.\n\nTurn on Cold Email Blocker [\n\nSmart Categories\n\nSmart Categories organize your emails by grouping similar senders together. This works perfectly with your AI assistant - tell it\n\nonce how to handle a category, and it'll take care of all future emails automatically.\n\nGot a lot of newsletters? Just click "Archive All" on the newsletter category and watch thousands of old emails clear out in\n\nseconds. Then tell your AI assistant to automatically archive future newsletters, and you'll never have to deal with inbox clutter\n\nSome examples of smart categories (but you can create any category you want):\n\n* Newsletters\n\n* Customers\n\n* Investors\n\nSet up smart categories [\n\nGain insights into your inbox to master your email management. Understand what is filling up your inbox and devise an effective\n\naction plan.\n\nIf you'd like help getting set up, you can book a free 15 minute onboarding call:\n\nBook Onboarding Call [\n\nPrefer to chat over email?
